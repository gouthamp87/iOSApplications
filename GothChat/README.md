# Goth-Chat
A simple Chat app using Firebase4. This is just demo and doesn't do much.

## Podfile Configuration
```
post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
            config.build_settings['CLANG_WARN_DOCUMENTATION_COMMENTS'] = 'NO'
        end
    end
end
```

## Finished App

## NOTES
The Chameleon and SVProgressHUD were meant to be used to make various effects and would be a good addition for User Experience.
